# Code Book

## Raw Data
Please refer to the excellent code book in ./raw_data for detailed information on the raw data and its variables.
The raw data and all meta data surrounding it originate from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

## Cleaned Data
The following subsections describe the clean data in the folder ./clean_data and what transformations were applied to the raw data to arrive at the clean data.

### Data
The single source of raw data is the accelerometer data from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone (cf. **Raw Data**).

### Variables
All variables are thoroughly explained in the code book of the accelerometer data (cf. **Raw Data**).
The only variables that were introduced in the cleaning procedure are averages of existing variables, and are specifically indicated (see below: Transformation)

### Transformations
The raw data consists of two disjoint data sets, namely *train* and *test*.
To facilitate our analysis, the three text files in each data sets (subject_train.txt, X_train.txt, y_train.txt and subject_test.txt, X_test.txt, y_test.txt) were first merged (column bind) into one data table per data set.
The two data tables were then merged (row binding) into one large data table, which was stored as ./clean_data/data.csv. The column names were transferred from the raw data, according to the respective code book. In order to comply with the requirements for column names presented in Lecture 4, the column names were converted to lower case and underscores/dots/whitespaces/brackets were removed.

Furthermore, measurements on the mean and standard deviation were extracted and stored in ./clean_data/OnlyMeanAndStdMeasurement.csv. The respective measurements were determined by looking for substrings "mean" and "std" in the column names.

Lastly, a summary of ./clean_data/OnlyMeanAndStdMeasurement.csv was created by taking the mean of each column, grouped by activity and subject.
In order to distinguish these averaged variables from raw data variables, the string "mean" is prefixed.
